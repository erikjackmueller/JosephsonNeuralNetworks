# JosepshonNeuralNetworks



## Description

This repocitory is built for the analysis of Josephson Junction based Neurons interfacing in realistic neural networks

## Requirements
The analysis in this prject is build around simulations in JoSIM (https://joeydelp.github.io/JoSIM/)
For this project to function properly in combination with JoSIM, JoSIM will need to available via the command line, specifically the executable 'josim-cli'.
